  <h2>General Info</h2>
    <p class="paragraphindent">The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes 
      residing in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment to learn and play soccer. 
      To be a member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago 
      northside neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the 
      generous volunteer time of parents and former league members.
